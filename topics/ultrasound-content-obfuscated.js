This process is time-consuming and introduces variability between practitioners.\n\nAn alternative approach worth exploring: combining ultrasound imaging with deep learning to automatically identify bone and tissue structures, potentially making prosthesis design faster, more accurate, and more consistent."

Key advantages for ultrasound applications:\n\n• Self-configuring architecture that adapts to different datasets without manual tuning\n• Proven performance in medical imaging benchmarks\n• Robust handling of ultrasound-specific artifacts (speckle noise, acoustic shadows)\n• Effective even with limited training data\n\nTechnical Note: nnU-Net's automatic configuration includes preprocessing, network architecture selection, and training strategy optimization based on dataset properties."
